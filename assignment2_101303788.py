    # Q3: What is the benefit of using @property and @target.setter?
    # Using @property and @target.setter lets the program control how the private
    # target value is accessed and changed. This is useful because we can add
    # validation, like rejecting an empty string, without changing how the rest
    # of the code uses target. It also helps keep the class safer and easier to maintain.

# Q1: How does PortScanner reuse code from NetworkTool?
# PortScanner reuses code from NetworkTool by inheriting from it instead of
# rewriting the target-related logic again. For example, PortScanner uses
# super().__init__(target) to set up the private target value from the parent
# class, and it also reuses the target property and setter validation.

        # Without the try-except block, a socket error could stop the whole
        # program while scanning. For example, if the target machine is unreachable
        # or there is a network problem, the program might crash before finishing
        # the rest of the ports. Exception handling makes the scanner more reliable.

    # Q2: Why do we use threading instead of scanning one port at a time?
    # Threading allows many ports to be scanned at the same time, which makes
    # the scanner much faster. If 1024 ports were scanned one at a time, the
    # program would take much longer because each port could wait up to the timeout
    # before moving on. Using threads improves efficiency during the scan.

# Q5: New Feature Proposal
# One extra feature I would add is a port risk classifier that labels open ports
# as high, medium, or low risk. This could use a nested if-statement to check
# whether each open port belongs to different risk groups, then print a clearer
# security summary for the user.
